You must be wondering on how to start with ethical hacking you might have some knowledge but you strongly want to learn then follow this pathway we documented

# Cybersecurity Pathway
Best way to start of is TryHackMe, Trust me I've learnt a lot from CTFs but that isn't much until I got exposed to TryHackMe and it made my learning faster
1. [TryHackMe Pathways](https://tryhackme.com/paths)
	a. Pre-Security Path  -> If you don't know networking and basic IT Stuff
	b. Complete Beginner Path -> For everyone who's interested in ethical hacking
	c. Web Fundamentals -> Web Penetration Testing Basics

If you're completed with these pathway's regardless of paid rooms

NOTE: If a room is paid or premium try searching for the alternative content on google and you could ask us!! [ISFCR Discord Community](https://bit.ly/isfcr-discord)

**If you don't find the room in pathway to be paid go to [Tryhackme Search](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities?tab=search) and Enter the Keyword**
